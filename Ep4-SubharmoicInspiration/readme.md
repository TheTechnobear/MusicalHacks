# SubHarm - Subharmonic Inspiration

a bela project (subharm) inspired by the moog subharmonicon

see https://youtu.be/OAEuMkb3r0g


note:
This is the code as produced for the above video, and I will keep 'as-is',  so that you can follow on the video.
(so a good place to understand the code!)

However, if I decide to enhance and alter it, it will be in my main bela repo
https://github.com/BelaPatches

probably under the sub directory c++/subharm (thats where it is at the moment ;) )
